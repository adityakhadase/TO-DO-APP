# 📝 Daily To-Do App

## 🚀 Project Overview
This simple and intuitive To-Do List app was built after completing a foundational journey into JavaScript. It helps organize daily tasks and reflects the features and concepts I’ve learned—such as DOM manipulation, localStorage, event handling, and dynamic UI updates.

## ✨ Features
- Add new tasks dynamically
- Delete tasks with a single click
- Persist tasks using `localStorage`
- Responsive task interface with visual feedback

## 🧠 Learning Highlights
While building this, I explored and applied:
- Accessing and modifying the DOM with `getElementById` and `querySelector`
- Creating elements on the fly with `createElement`
- Attaching event listeners manually and programmatically
- Using `localStorage` to persist user data
- Handling data consistency across reloads
- Adding classes and basic styling for visual clarity

## 💻 Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## 🛠 How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Enter a task in the input box and click `ADD`.
4. Click the ❌ icon to delete tasks.
5. Tasks are automatically saved to your browser—so they're still there next time.

## 📸 Interface
The UI features a modern gradient background, a central task card, and minimalist controls to ensure usability. Example task: **“Javascript Done”** gets stored with delete capability for better task flow.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Add check/uncheck task status with animations
- Task categories and priority tagging
- Sync tasks across devices with backend integration
